      <h1>Reflection on "As We May Think"</h1>
      <h2>By Ziqian (Catherine) Zhang</h2>
      <p>Technology has made many achievements that have made human life more satisfying. Productivity has 
        increased dramatically, and communication across space and time has become easier. Scientists never 
        reach the end of the field they need to explore. </p>
          
      <p>In this reading, the author pointed out that human experience and research have been published and 
        documented far more than we can actually put to use and expand in depth, with the result that some 
        important milestones have been buried in insignificant records. But the author argued that this 
        problem can be changed by sophisticated science. Records come in many different forms, and human 
        beings are constantly developing techniques for recording information and transmitting it. The 
        author provided a very professional description of this historical development. </p>

      <p>In fact, the current technology, including AI, databases, etc., which can be considered whimsical 
        technology at the time of the author, has now become mainstream, and there is a certain number of 
        people with related knowledge keeping research and exploring. Search engines may not be fully 
        perfected, but access to recent records is already in the hands of everyone, as long as one has a 
        device that can connect to the Internet.</p>
